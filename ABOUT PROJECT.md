In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time. 
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers while those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 

The overall goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members while the aim of this presentation is to identify how annual members and casual riders differ in bike usage.
